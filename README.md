# my assumptions 

if robot in max y coordinate robot can not move north so stay same position until direction change  
if robot in max y coordinate robot can not move south so stay same position until direction change  
if robot in max x coordinate robot can not move east so stay same position until direction change  
if robot in min x coordinate robot can not move west so stay same position until direction change
